_If you have any remarks about your submission (e.g., you couldn't complete all tasks, you had troubles with a particular task...), please let your tutor know by adding a comment here or in the Jupyter notebook._

#### Setup:

To run the project make sure that you have a live server installed (e.g. [Live Server for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)) and the entire repository is in the working/root directory of your editor.
Start the server and a browser window should open.
Any changes you make in the code should directly be visible in your browser.

For debugging and finding errors use the Developer Tools of your browser. In Chrome and Firefox you can open them with the Shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I or the key F12.
